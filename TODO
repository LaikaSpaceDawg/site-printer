have backlog not cut between every message?
add support for psuedo markdown tags?
	for instance:
	<center> to center align text between them
		would require more preprocessing, probably computing the length of each line, padding with spaces 
		on either end equally as needed to reach the wrap threshold
	<right> to right align
		would require more preprocessing, probably also line length but only pad the right up to 48
	<left> is default and does not need tags
